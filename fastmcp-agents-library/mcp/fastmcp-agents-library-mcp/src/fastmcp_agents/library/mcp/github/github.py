# GitHub Issue and Pull Request Search Syntax Summary

*   **Case Insensitivity**: Search is not case sensitive.
*   **Multi-word Terms**: Use double quotes around multi-word search terms (e.g., `label:"help wanted"`).
*   **Exclusion**: Use a minus (`-`) symbol before a qualifier to exclude results (e.g., `-author:octocat`). This does not work for `no:` qualifiers.
*   **Boolean Operators**:
    *   `AND`: Returns results where both statements are true (e.g., `label:"question" AND assignee:octocat`). A space between statements is treated as `AND`.
    *   `OR`: Returns results where either statement is true (e.g., `assignee:octocat OR assignee:hubot`).
*   **Nesting Filters**: Use parentheses `()` to group qualifiers for more complex filters (up to five levels deep). Example: `(type:"Bug" AND assignee:octocat) OR (type:"Feature" AND assignee:hubot)`
*   **Date Formatting**: Dates follow ISO8601 standard: `YYYY-MM-DD`. Optional time: `THH:MM:SS+00:00`.
*   **Range Qualifiers**: Use `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `..` for numerical and date ranges (e.g., `comments:>100`, `created:<2011-01-01`, `comments:500..1000`).
