## Start running with the bundled MCP servers

FastMCP-Agents comes bundled with some great MCP Servers. These bundled servers demonstrate how to integrate third-party MCP servers and expose them with augmented agents and tools.

The following bundled servers are available:

- [Aider](../src/fastmcp_agents/bundled/servers/strawgate_aider-wrapper-mcp/README.md)
- [Claude Code](../src/fastmcp_agents/bundled/servers/claude_claude-code-mcp/README.md)
- [DuckDB](../src/fastmcp_agents/bundled/servers/motherduckdb_mcp-server-motherduck/README.md)
- [DuckDuckGo (from nickclyde)](../src/fastmcp_agents/bundled/servers/nickclyde_duckduckgo-mcp-server/README.md)
- [Git (from Cyanheads)](../src/fastmcp_agents/bundled/servers/cyanheads_git-mcp-server/README.md)
- [Git (from MCP)](../src/fastmcp_agents/bundled/servers/mcp_git/README.md)
- [Github](../src/fastmcp_agents/bundled/servers/github_github-mcp-server/README.md)
- [Tree Sitter](../src/fastmcp_agents/bundled/servers/wrale_mcp-server-tree-sitter/README.md)

In each doc we include how to run the server with ðŸ”Ž MCP Inspector, how to call the tools via the CLI, how to use the server in an MCP Server configuration, and how to use the server in Open WebUI.
