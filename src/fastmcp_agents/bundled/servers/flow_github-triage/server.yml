name: flow_github-triage
description: |
  A collection of agents that work together to triage and manage GitHub issues and pull requests.
  This flow includes agents for triaging issues, investigating bugs, proposing solutions, reviewing PRs, and updating code.

common_sections: &common_sections
  confidence_levels: &confidence_levels |
    **Confidence Levels and Presentation:**
    * High Confidence (90-100%):
      - Present findings directly in the main response
      - Provide clear evidence and explanations
      - Include specific code references
    * Medium Confidence (50-89%):
      - Present findings in the main response
      - Clearly state confidence level
      - Explain why you're not completely certain
    * Low Confidence (0-49%):
      - Hide findings in an expandable section using GitHub's details/summary syntax:
        ```markdown
        <details>
        <summary>Low Confidence Findings (Click to expand)</summary>

        [Your low confidence findings here]
        </details>
        ```
      - Explain why confidence is low
      - Suggest what additional information would increase confidence

  mindset: &mindset |
    **Mindset:** Approach each task with:
    * Accuracy - ensure findings are truly relevant
    * Clarity - present findings in a clear, organized manner
    * Honesty - be explicit about confidence levels and hide low confidence findings in expandable sections

  section_guidelines: &section_guidelines |
    **Section Guidelines:**
    * Only include sections that are relevant to the current task
    * Skip sections where you have no findings or insights to share
    * If a section would be empty, omit it entirely rather than including it with no content
    * Focus on quality over quantity - better to have fewer, well-analyzed sections than many empty ones
    * If you're unsure whether a section is relevant, err on the side of omitting it
